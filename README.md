## How to Submit Your Project

Follow these steps to submit your project for the TPAC Hackathon.

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Navigate to the top right of this repository and click the **Fork** button.
2. This will create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

### 2. Clone Your Fork Locally

Once you've forked the repo, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elenalape/hackathon-tpac-2024.git
cd hackathon-tpac-2024
```

### 3. Add Your Project

1. In the cloned repository, navigate to the `submissions/` directory.
2. Add your HTML file to the `submissions/` directory. Name your HTML file appropriately (e.g. `your-username.html` or `your-project-name.html`).

**Important:** Make sure your HTML file contains the following tags:

- A `<title>` tag with the title of your project.

```html
<title>Your Project Title</title>
```

- A `<meta name="author">` tag with your name or names, if you're working as a pair.

```html
<meta name="author" content="Your Name" />
```

- If your project uses external CSS or JavaScript files, include them in the `submissions/` directory as well, and reference them in your HTML file.

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Once you've added your project, commit your changes:

```bash
git add submissions/your-username.html
git commit -m "Add your project"
git push origin main
```

### 5. Create a Pull Request

1. Navigate to the original repository at GitHub (this one).
2. Click the **Pull Requests** tab.
3. Click the **New Pull Request** button.
4. Select your fork in the **base repository** dropdown.
5. Click the **Create Pull Request** button.

Once your pull request is approved, your project will be live on the hackathon website!
